<h1>Hi 👋, I'm Jerrison 👨‍💻</h1>

<h3>I'm a passionate front-end developer from Toronto with a background in design</h3>

🎨 As a former designer, I bring a unique perspective to coding. My journey in design fuels my drive to create visually appealing and intuitive interfaces while ensuring they are functional and user-friendly.

🌟 When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new design trends, playing video games, or occasionally enjoying the great outdoors.
